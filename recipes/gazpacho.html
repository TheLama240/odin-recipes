    <p>Gazpacho is a traditional spanish dish which is unique to spanish culture. It is often described as a cold tomato soup which doesn't do it justice. It is a tomato dish that is refreshing and salty. Perfect for a summer day!</p>
    <p>The history of gazpacho comes from the spanish countryside. Summers in spain can be extremely hot so a cool tomato beverage was a respite for workers coming back from the field for a traditional siesta.</p>
